  // Encapsulation is a feature of angular that let's each component have a unique class
  // for which angular then applies the styles found in the component's styleUrls (or styles).
  // For example, adding color red to this component's scss file will change all text to red within
  // this component; The way the color: red is applied, though, is via the encapsulation class that's
  // applied to this component's html elements found within the html file (templateUrl).
  // Setting ViewEncapsulation.None turns this angular feature off.Turning off encapsulation
  // removes the html classes which then opens up the component to be modified by other existing styles
  // from parent components. Encapsulation also ensures that other component styling (like parent components)
  // don't leak into this component.

  // Using providers: is how you provide DI of a service when the service itself is not injectable via root using the following:
  // @Injectable({
  //    providedIn: 'root'
  // })
  // As for providers, use the following code:
  // providers: [LoggingService]
  // Another way is to use the inject method to assign a local property the service. The following code illustrates that:
  // this.loggingService = inject(LoggingService);
  // Important note: The service that's injected will also be instance that's injected to child components.
  // "The instances don't propogate up, they only go down that tree of components"
  // Another thing to note is that adding the service to the providers will create a new instance of thet service.
  // Of course, adding the service to the providers list of the app module will ensure every injection shares the same instance.
  // The aforementioned statement is true unless it's overwritten using a local providers service declaration.
  // The @Injectable() meta data tag needs to be added to classes that are not components or directives to ensure that
  // the Angular dependency injector can inject services to the constructor; This is true for services.
